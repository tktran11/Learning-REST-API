# REST API

This is a basic rest api built while learning
Python with Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, and Flask-SQLAlchemy. 
It serves the purpose of showcasing the basics of data storage and 
user authentification through an API. 

Enables creation of "multiple stores" to house "items" with distinct names
and prices. These can be updated to remove items or alter their prices. 

Deployed on Heroku.
